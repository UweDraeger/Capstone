## Project Notes

Task 1 - Getting and cleaning the data
Tokenization - use the tidytext framework rather than trying to build a mini-version independently. 

Section recommends to use random sampling to build a model.
I question to usefulness of random data compared to just top 500 lines or so.
The final work will be on the complate dataset, i.e. the "population" - which is of course only a sample of the unavailable universe of all text). For constructing the tools for model building specific parameter values and their representativeness should not matter much.
